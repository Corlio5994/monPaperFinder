#Concept
I'm completing this project as part of the Microsoft Student Accelerator program. 

The intent of this project is to create a tool that can be utilised alongside the Arxiv website, which collects research papers. As a first-year student with an interest in research, I have often found myself wanting to further my studies by reading research papers, but without completing further studies in my areas of interest, many research papers are impenetrable. I wanted to create a tool that could make it easier to find papers linked to a specific field of an academic domain, utilising the information available about Monash courses online to tailor this project to undergraduates in a similar position to me. Future extensions of the project could include implementation adapted for other universities, or with more granular analysis of the accessibility of content in research papers. 

#This project and AI
This project is uniquely suited for an Artificial Intelligence solution. Performing a complex analysis of features and content within a paper and categorising it based on the results would be a time-consuming and nigh-impossible task without training a computational model that can learn to make its own predictions. In particular, a clustering model for machine-learning provides an approach to this problem which allows the program to perform feature identification rather than the builder of the program, which results in a more precise feature analysis for predictions than one that is human-created would typically be.
