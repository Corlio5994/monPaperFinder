# Reflection 

This project manifested in an entirely different way than I had imagined it. I'd never have thought I'd decide to embark on a project of this scale, and before beginning, I had little 
to no idea that this project would take nearly as much work as it did. I'm really sorry that this project is in this scattered form, without any tangible results which would be simple to grade.
I really really wanted to at least manage a complete machine-learning model, even if I didn't get the webpage/API functioning correctly, but as it eventually turned out, ~30 hours was only enough 
to transform my data into something usable. 

I've learnt a lot over the course of this project. I've learnt the importance of choosing a machine learning architecture in very clear, discrete terms before you start building, 
and how vital it is to have data in a form which can be manipulated. I've learnt the difference between different forms of word-encoding in pytorch, and how to use this and many
other Python libraries more effectively. I've also learnt the importance of choosing a project of the appropriate scale- I tend to get carried away easily, and this project 
was definitely beyond my abilities within the 15-24 hours of work suggested. In the future, I'll now know to pull the plug and start working on another, more *achievable* project
when I realise that a project is too difficult to complete in the limited time I have to complete it. 

This may not be a great example of work to submit for the MSA program, but this process has definitely taught me a lot and improved my skills with data processing and machine 
learning!
